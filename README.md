# Test-restfulapi

Solution of problem 1

I have used the following tools:

Programming language: python

Additional libraries: flask-restful

For testing the api, I have used the tool Insomnia.

The python requirement which is needed in order to run the app can be found in file requirements.txt

Person entities are stored in the data.json

How to build:

python app.py data.json

Then using the Insomnia rest client, One can query all the four essential methods i.e GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.

Due to time constraints I am not able to deploy it using the Docker, since I am getting some errors while mounting the data.json file as an argument while doing the docker run.
